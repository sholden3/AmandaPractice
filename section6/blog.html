    <h2>I Really Love Game of Thrones</h2>

    <p class="quote">I am Daenerys Stormborn, of House Targaryen,
        of the blood of Old Valyria – I am the Dragon’s Daughter.
        And I swear to you, that those who would harm you will
        die screaming.
    </p>

    <p>The North remembers. Fire and blood. The rains of castamere.
        Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall. The wolf and the lion.
        The Knight of Lemonwood. Bastards are born of passion, aren't they?
        We don't despise them in Dorne. The North remembers. Unbowed, Unbent,
        Unbroken. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this
        night and all the nights to come. Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall.
        May the Father judge him justly. A good act does not wash out the bad,
        nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. Words are like
        wind. The night is dark and full of terrors. A good act does not wash out
        the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward.
        Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall. The Knight of Lemonwood.
        The North remembers. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act
        the good. Each should have its own reward. It's ten thousand miles between
        Kings landing and the wall.</p>

    <p>Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. All men must die.
        All men must die. The tourney of Ashford Meadows. What is dead may never die.
        The Knight of Lemonwood. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch,
        for this night and all the nights to come. King in the North. The tourney
        of Ashford Meadows. The Knight of Lemonwood. The Dothraki do things in
         their own time, for their own reasons. House Tarly of Horn Hill The
         North remembers. A Lannister always pays his debts. The tourney of
         Ashford Meadows. All men must die. All men must die. The War of the 5 kings.
         The battle of the redgrass field. Winter is coming. I would like a trial by combat.
         The tourney of Ashford Meadows. A dream of Spring. Winter is coming.
         Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days. Lucky for the ladies.
         Pay the iron price. I would like a trial by combat. A dream of Spring.
         More pigeon pie, please.</p>
